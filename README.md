This course explores the recent and ongoing economic journeys of Asian-Pacific economies, highlighting their growth stories and development strategies using straightforward economic concepts. Designed for students new to economics, the course avoids technical jargon and focuses on real-world examples, trends, and debates shaping Asia's rise.

- **Asia's "Economic Miracle"**: What fueled rapid development in countries like Japan, South Korea, and China? We’ll discuss industrialization, trade, and unique local strategies.
- **Demongraphic Changes**: How population trends (like youth booms or aging societies) shape economies, jobs, and future challenges.
- **Asia-Pacific in the Global Economy**: How Asian countries trade, compete, and collaborate internationally, from factories to digital innovation.
- **Government's Role**: Case studies on how policies—from education to infrastructure—helped (or sometimes hindered) development.
- **Spotlight Economies**: Compare successes and struggles across Asia-Pacific areas, including East Asian "tigers" Japan and Korea, "powerhouse" China, "supercities" Hong Kong and Singapore, and rapidly growing Souteast Asian economies.

**Course Style**:  
- **Accessible Approach**: No advanced economics background needed—ideas are explained through stories, data visuals, and current events.
- **Interactive Learning**: Discussions, case studies, and group projects connect theory to real-life challenges.
- **Takeaways**: Gain a clearer picture of Asia's economic diversity, its global influence, and how everyday issues (like job markets or inflation) fit into bigger trends.
