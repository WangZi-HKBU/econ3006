Spring 2025

This course explores the recent and ongoing economic journeys of Asian-Pacific economies, highlighting their growth stories and development strategies using straightforward economic concepts. Designed for students new to economics, the course avoids technical jargon and focuses on real-world examples, trends, and debates shaping Asia's rise.

## Key Themes Include
- **How Economies Grow**: The role of resources (like labor and investment), efficiency, technology, and government policies in driving growth.
- **Asia's "Economic Miracle"**: What fueled rapid development in countries like Japan, South Korea, and China? We’ll discuss industrialization, trade, and unique local strategies.
- **Demongraphic Changes**: How population trends (like youth booms or aging societies) shape economies, jobs, and future challenges.
- **Asia-Pacific in the Global Economy**: How Asian countries trade, compete, and collaborate internationally, from factories to digital innovation.
- **Government's Role**: Case studies on how policies—from education to infrastructure—helped (or sometimes hindered) development.
- **Spotlight Economies**: Compare successes and struggles across Asia-Pacific areas, including East Asian "tigers" Japan and Korea, "powerhouse" China, "supercities" Hong Kong and Singapore, and rapidly growing Souteast Asian economies.

## Course Style
- **Accessible Approach**: No advanced economics background needed—ideas are explained through stories, data visuals, and current events.
- **Interactive Learning**: Discussions, case studies, and group projects connect theory to real-life challenges.
- **Takeaways**: Gain a clearer picture of Asia's economic diversity, its global influence, and how everyday issues (like job markets or inflation) fit into bigger trends.

Perfect for students interested in business, international relations, or policy—or anyone curious about how Asia became an economic powerhouse!
